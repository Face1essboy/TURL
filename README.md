# TURL
This Repo contains coda and data for "TURL: Table Understanding through Representation Learning". 

*We are cleaning and refactoring the code and will push the official release together with data and detailed documentation once that is done.*

## Data
TODO: Link for processed pretraining and evaluation data

TODO: Instruction for preparing code from original WikiTable Corpus

## Pretraining
TODO

## Evaluation
To systematically evaluate our pre-trained framework as well as facilitate research, we compile a table understanding benchmark consisting of 6 widely studied tasks covering
table interpretation (e.g., entity linking, column type annotation, relation extraction) and table augmentation (e.g., row population, cell filling, schema augmentation).

TODO: Refactoring the evaluation scripts and add instruction.

## Acknowledgement
We use the [WikiTable corpus](http://websail-fe.cs.northwestern.edu/TabEL/) for developing the dataset for pretraining and most of the evaluation. 
We also adopt the [WikiGS](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~oktie/webtables/) for evaluation of entity linking.

We use multiple existing systems as baseline for evaluation. We took the code released by the author and made minor changes to fit our setting, please refer to the paper for more details.
